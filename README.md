Module 5 Weekly Challenge

Hello, 

I found this week's challenge to be the most challenging yet! I struggled especially with the Quartile and Outliers section. I was able to calculate the IQR and Outliers individually for each of the four drugs in question but had to try many different iterations in order to get my for loop to function correctly. I understand the IQRs and Outliers but something about when I tried to code it in a loop, threw me for a loop. 

When I finally did get it, I attempted to clean my code and must've lost something in the process because it stopped calculating the outliers correctly. I didn't have a previous version with the new part but without the cleaned code. Going forward, I know now to commit to Git more and earlier. Additionally, when I finally did get the for loop to work correctly it was a little bit different than my first few tries but made sense and yielded results similar to the starter code. 

Despite that and a few other challenges, I found the plotting itself to be more straightforward and enjoyable. 

Also, as an FYI, my code is saved under the name pymaceuticals in the Pymaceuticals folder.

Thanks!
